  <center><h2>DVRMobile v1.2.1-0</h2></center>
  <br>
  <b>DVRMobile</b> began as a simple idea:  your TiVo needs media to display and your iPhone is a wireless multimedia device.  DVRMobile implements the <i>HMO (Home Media Option)</i> protocol and the <i>DVRMobile Discovery</i> protocol in order to detect TiVo devices on your local wireless network as well as serve up multimedia requests from your iPhone to your TiVo device.

  <br>
  In <b>DVRMobile</b> version 1, you may stream Photos, including those taken by your camera and those transferred to your Photo library using iTunes; and Audio, including those transferred to your iTunes library and those downloaded using dTunes.  Future versions of DVRMobile plan to support streaming video content as well, along with a list of other convenient features.
